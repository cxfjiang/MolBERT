The Blood-brain barrier penetration (BBBP) dataset is extracted from a study on the modeling and prediction of the barrier permeability. As a membrane separating circulating blood and brain extracellular fluid, the blood-brain barrier blocks most drugs, hormones and neurotransmitters. Thus penetration of the barrier forms a long-standing issue in development of drugs targeting central nervous system. This dataset includes binary labels for over 2000 compounds on their permeability properties. 

The data file contains a csv table, in which columns below are used:
     "name" - Name of the compound
     "smiles" - SMILES representation of the molecular structure
     "p_np" - Binary labels for penetration/non-penetration
