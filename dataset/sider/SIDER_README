The Side Effect Resource (SIDER) is a database of marketed drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADR). The version of the SIDER dataset in DeepChem has grouped drug side effects into 27 system organ classes following MedDRA classifications measured for 1427 approved drugs.

The data file contains a csv table, in which columns below are used:
     "smiles" - SMILES representation of the molecular structure
     "Hepatobiliary disorders" ~ "Injury, poisoning and procedural complications" - Recorded side effects for the drug
	Please refer to http://sideeffects.embl.de/se/?page=98 for details on ADRs.
